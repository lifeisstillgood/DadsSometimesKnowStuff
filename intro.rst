Theory of government
Standing on a wall of democracy / freedom agains the zombie hoards
but alone
but joined by neighbours
but now who will go for a pee
who
will fetch water, ammunition 
who will take turns sleeping and repairing the wall and fixing the leaking taps and the sewer is backed up and causing disease and who will run the hospital

Organisational problems are all
solvable, few are complicated but they all need solving

the market will rarely work well (companies / people will take advantage) and markets need rules and enforcement 

And so we get here 

The questions for government shoukd be what is our ideal
state, and how do we work out the rules that will get us there.

Not "who is in charge" cos that's arguing over wrong problems 

A culture war is at least arguing over what society shoukd lookmlike - it's just a poorly argued by idiots



Anyhow - we live in a socialist utopia.  i benefit from work of brilliant geniuses and slogging workhorses who have dragged a world into being and shared their ideas for free or left their labour as capital to be reused (I don't give the person who laid down the paving stones a fee each time I walk on their labour) 

it is why subscription models are ultimately a failure - we build capital for the good of all, but rentier-ism tries to falsely capture that.

but i don't know the ideas either - this book is about the ideas and how to recreate them

Blackboard of Nobel prizewinning physicist Feynman - "what i cannot recreate I do not understand"

So this is my journey through the history of science - recreating the experiments and the historical context
